    The online challenge: HR has a pretty simple JS challenge to make sure the applicant understands the most basic aspects of functions, arrays, and strings. I found this pretty cool as it makes sure that people applying have at least tried to learn on their own a little bit before looking for schools.  After completion of the challenge I was invited to schedule a technical interview slot. <br><br>

    Interview 1: I was a bit unnerved that I would not be able to find a slot. Each day I would check their site to find all times booked, seeing this was also a blow to my confidence. With so many people applying, they must be able to only select the most qualified people. I tried to shrug it off and continued my studies, making sure to do a balance of coding and reading new concepts. It was at this point that I finally was able to understand the concept of closures. After a couple of weeks had passed, I checked the interview slot openings and there was an opening the following day! Someone must have cancelled because everything    <CUT>else was full. I was not confident that I was ready, but had my doubts that I would find another opening that month, so I took the plunge and booked it. <br><br>

    That evening I tried to quickly review all materials on basic functional JS concepts. I skimmed over eloquent JS for the 3rd time and listened to Learn and Understand JS, a udemy course at 2x speed. This las minute cram session did not really help very much, as I would find out the next day. Note: All resources I used are listed at the bottom of this post.<br><br>

      The following day I was lucky to have no commitments other than my interview that was scheduled for 2:00pm. Thirty minutes before, I was really feeling the nerves, and the overly large cup of coffee that I had just downed. My palms were perspiring as I answered the skype call, but they need not have been. My interviewer was named Andrew and he was a recent graduate of HR. We chatted a bit about my background, and why I thought HR was the best coding school out there. Andrew also played classical piano outside of his work so we were able to discuss music a little bit as well.
    Then we entered the technical part, starting off easy until we reached something that I could not do. One thing that I had not prepared for was vocalizing my thoughts as I struggled through the problems. This is really more difficult than it sounds and your own voice can be very distracting, and puts your mind in a different state than what you are used to. <br><br>

    No cigar: I received my gentle rejection letter 4 days later while on a hike. I say gentle because HR allows you to interview again after more self study, if they feel that you just need more time. They also informed me that I needed to create a project to get more hands on experience. I defiantly took this news as a glass half full situation. I had not been rejected, yet so I started brainstorming what I should make to really show off and improve my skills. I was thinking some sort of two player game with a common server, something starwars themed. After looking into it a bit though this idea seemed way over my head. The week before I had watched a computerfile video about ARE WE LIVING IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION? In this episode they talked about Conway's game of life and, not having any CS or mathmatical background this was my first exposure to this concept. I set about making my own game of life with HTML CSS and the DOM. <br><br>

    I wanted the game to be an interactive simulation, where the user would be able to drag and drop interesting pre made patterns on to the life board. There is a community of people documenting all of these patterns so I picked my favorites. Now I set to work and started sketching out the logic on 4 big pieces of blank paper. I wanted the user to be able to resize the grid, set the speed of the game, change color, make their own rules, and drag and drop patterns. This list grew as I was making my sketches. Overall I am not sure how much time I spent on this project because the hours would fly by, but it was completed in less than a month and is hosted here:
    I would say that the most important thing I learned from this project was the module pattern. <br><br>

    Interview II: My cross browser support consisted of sending my app to a couple friends and they said it worked, so I sent it in to HR. The next day they emailed me back saying that I was ready to schedule another interview. This time I decided to not make any rash decisions about when to do it, and give myself at least another three weeks. It was over these next weeks that I got into a more functional style of javascript and wrote down a practice schedule to follow making sure I would both read, read code, and code every day. Rescources are listed at the end of this post. <br><br>

    I was able to find an interview slot a little less than a month out and I took it. When the day came, this time I did not drink a ton of coffee, and took a break the evening before. I got plenty of sleep and went for a walk in the cool winter air before the interview. The interview itself was very similar to the first. After initial introductions and questions, we linked into a common document and started off with easy challenges. The problems were very similar to the first interview so I had studied them many many times over the past month. When we got to new material I again struggled, but not as poorly and was eventually able to solve everything until we ran out of time. <br><br><br><br>
